    <h2>Eligibility for Refunds</h2>
    <p>Customers may request a refund for purchases made directly through the Optimuu platform. Optimuu reserves the sole and absolute discretion to determine if misuse or abuse has occurred.</p>

        <li>Requests for refunds of purchases not made on the Optimuu platform.</li>
        <li>Refund requests for self-initiated purchases.</li>
        <li>Refund requests for transactions that have already been reversed through chargebacks.</li>
        <li>Filing excessive or duplicate claims (more than three times in one month).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submitting a Claim</h2>
    <p>To be eligible for a refund, you must meet the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You still own the payment method used for the purchase and can receive funds back to that payment method.</li>
        <li>You did not contribute to, participate in, or induce any misuse or abuse, directly or indirectly.</li>
        <li>You have completed the required claim form and provided all requested information for evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By submitting a claim, you agree to cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by Optimuu or relevant authorities.</p>

    <h2>Processing Refunds</h2>
    <p>Once a refund is issued, the purchaser will be notified. Personal information provided in the claim process will remain confidential, except as required to process the refund.</p>

    <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>Optimuu reserves the right to modify or terminate this Policy at any time at its sole discretion, without prior notice. Changes will be posted on the Optimuu website.</p>
